            <h2 class="package__badge">RECOMMENDED</h2>
            <h2 class="package__subtitle">The most popular choice of our clients.</h2>
            <p class="package__info">The man-made diamond quarry was called "Mir" for a reason: having discovered the
                source, geologists sent to Moscow a coded radiogram: "We lit a pipe of peace, excellent tobacco." Why a
                pipe? It's simple: this is what geologists call such deposits. Nowadays, the mine is no longer
                operating, and tourists have a chance to look at a colossal quarry - one and a half kilometers in
                diameter! The Yakuts believe that diamond deposits in their lands are associated with intervention from
                above: once it was so cold that a deity hovering in the sky froze his hand and dropped a whole bag of
                diamonds on the ground.</p>

            <h2 class="package__subtitle">A quick start in exploring the nature of the Far East.</h2>
            <p class="package__info">Located on the Onekotan Island, the active volcano Krenitsyn is a truly unique
                phenomenon. This is not just a volcano, but a volcano within a volcano, and even the largest in the
                world. Around its top, overgrown with forests, a ring of lake closes, enclosed in flowering slopes -
                calderas. The mesmerizing landscape is complemented by the haze enveloping the lake - neither give nor
                take the scenery for "Jurassic Park"!</p>

            <h2 class="package__subtitle">Ideal for large groups of people.</h2>
            <p class="package__info">A huge ten-kilometer reservoir with four picturesque islets owes its name to an
                unusual find: an expedition that discovered the lake found on its shore a book by the famous writer Jack
                London. How the book got here and who the mysterious intellectual turned out to be in this deserted area
                of the Magadan region is unknown to this day.</p>

            <p class="package__info">The pebbles and sand of the bay mixed with glass cut by the sea. Red, blue, yellow,
                green - what kind of pebbles are not here! This is an ideal place for a spectacular photo shoot: glass
                pebbles shimmer in the sun with all the colors of the rainbow, sparkle and throw motley glare
                everywhere. Glass Bay is a unique phenomenon; you will not find a similar place in our country
                anymore.</p>

            <h1 class="package__title">Oymyakon, Yakutia</h1>
            <h2 class="package__badge-winter">WINTER SEASON</h2>
            <h2 class="package__subtitle">For the most persistent people.</h2>
            <p class="package__info">Oymyakon is a place where winter lasts almost 9 months, eyelashes become covered
                with frost in a couple of minutes in the cold, and reindeer racing is not an exotic entertainment, but a
                common thing. The translation of the name of this picturesque corner of Yakutia, at first glance, is
                completely illogical: "non-freezing water", but ironically, precisely because of the abnormally low
                temperatures, the soil and underground rivers freeze so much that their volume pushes the non-frozen
                water out. No wonder Oymyakon bears the proud status of the coldest city in Russia!</p>

            <h2 class="package__subtitle">You probably haven't seen anything like this before.</h2>
            <p class="package__info">Pumice rocks, sacred for the Itelmens, are a real place of power. According to
                legend, the creator of the world, Kutkh, who loved to fish on the Kuril Lake, folded his boats upside
                down so that he could go fishing at any time. This is how the Kutkhins Baty appeared - in translation
                "boats Kutkha" - picturesque slopes, the views of which are now admired by tourists. Locals make Kutkh
                figurines from wood and bone: they are purchased not only as souvenirs, but also as talismans.</p>
